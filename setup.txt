- Generate SSH key according to github guide. Instructions can be found
  by googling "Github generating SSH keys"

- To get ssh-agent working type in eval "$(ssh-agent -s)". This
  ensure that we export the environment variables ssh-agent spits out.

- type in $SSH_AGENT_PID and make sure the number matches the process
  created for the ssh-agent

- In ~/.ssh/ create a file called config

- Paste the below into the file
  Host github-user
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

- Change user to whatever you commented the key with for consistency.

- Install git if not allready installed.

- Next clone the git repo we want to push to:
  git clone git@github.com-user:user/your-repo-name.git name-for-folder
  Replace user with the github username
  Replace your-repo-name with the reponame
  Replace name-for-folder with the name of the folder required

- cd into the cloned directory and specify the user and email :
  git config user.name "user"
  git config user.email "emailAddress@gmail.com"

- All git commands should now work on that respository with no need to enter 
  a username or password.
