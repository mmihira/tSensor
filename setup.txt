- Generate SSH key according to github guide. Instructions can be found
  by googling "Github generating SSH keys"
- To get ssh-agent working type in eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
- type in $SSH_AGENT_PID and make sure the number matches the process
  created for the ssh-agent
- In ~/.ssh/ create a file called config
- Paste the below into the file
  Host github-<github username>
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
- Change Rasberry to whatever you commented the key with for consistency
- Install git if not allready installed
- git clone git@github.com-user1:user1/your-repo-name.git your-repo-name_user1
  replace user1 with the github username
  replace your-repo-name with the reponame
- cd into the cloned directory and specify the user and email :
  git config user.name "user1"
  git config user.email "zlayser@hotmail.com"
- All git commands should now work on that respository with no need to enter 
  a username or password
